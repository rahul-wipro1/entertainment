# Entertainment App
Entertainment app is an android app that demonstrates the use of MVVM Clean Architecture principle, Retrofit for API communication, and Data Binding for seamless UI updates.
## Features
1. **Clean Architecture:** The App is structured using clean Arch principles, with a clear seperation of layers: Presentation, Domain and Data. This promotes scalability, maintainability and testabililty of the code.
1. **MVVM Architecture:** The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, separating concerns between the UI(View), business logic (ViewModel) and data (Model).
1. **Retrofit2:** A popular HTTP clinet for Android, to make API call, this ensures efficient communication with the backend server.
1. **Fragments** UI components used to dispaly the views such as Images and text.
1. **RecyclerView** To display the list of items.

## Modularisation
Modularisation is the process of dividing a software code into smaller, independent and manageble components. Change in one module wont make much differnece in other module. The App follows two modules.
1. **app module**
1. **core module**
### app module
App module consists of presentation layer like Activity, fragment and ViewModel.
### core module 
Core module consists of data layer, domain layer and uicomponent.
